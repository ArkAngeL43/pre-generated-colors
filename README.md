for the past week or so prior to releasing this i have been working on inteligence based code generators, and with my upcoming learning in c++ and C i have been wanting to build generators and translators for c, c++, go, ruby, and perl. Well today i made this code generator to generate hpp and h files or c++/C header files for ASCII color codes. Below is a screenshot of all generated colors and what they may output, the names in the definitions can not be changed as of now, however later on in this projects development it will be added to learn based on the output of the color or from a database.
